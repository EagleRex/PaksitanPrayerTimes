## Pakistan Prayer Times - Privacy Policy

As an avid Android user myself, I take privacy very seriously.
I know how irritating it is when apps collect your data without your knowledge.

The app does not collect any personal data. All data (app preferences (like theme, etc.)) created by the you is stored on your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it.

The app uses Firebase service to track how many users are using the app.

Yours sincerely,
